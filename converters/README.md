# Converters
This directory contains some programs that can be used to convert the format of csv files.  
``tcase`` is a small csv file that can be used for testing.

###csv2binary
  **Usage:**

    csv2binary [input] [output]

  This program will read in the csv file with all double numbers specified in the command-line argument, parse them and save to the specified output file in binary format. The output file is written in row-oriented order.

  This code was written in Nov. 2015 when I was working on the major revision of the TKDE paper for the Gamma operator. I used this program to convert the KDD Cup data set from csv format to binary format. The binary file generated by this program became the input of the *"Load2D"* SciDB operator.


###tab2vert
  **Usage:**

    tab2verti [file name]

  This program will convert the given csv file from tabular format to vertical format.  
  For example, given the following input:  
> 12, 27, 53  
49, 25, 96

  The output will be:
> 1, 1, 12  
1, 2, 27  
1, 3, 53  
2, 1, 49  
2, 2, 25  
2, 3, 96  

  This is very useful to convert the format of the csv file for SciDB array importing.
